## Welcome to Constellation

Want to life hack using real, usable psychology?  Constellation will let you do that!

Constellation is an interactive website that promotes psychology by making practical psychology accessible to everyone.  The practical psyhcology we offer can be used to boost your every-day well being (want to feel happier or read facial expressions?  We offer practical psychology on that!).  We offer practical psychology in different branches of psychology, ranging from social to physiological; this means you will get to use practical psychology from nearly every field of psychology.


## Why Constellation?

Constellation cares that you get understandable high quality, practical psychology all in one place.

Constellation publishes only the highest quality practical psychology findings.  The findings we publish are systematically reviews and/or meta-analyzed, meaning that psychologists have tested them to the highest possible standards to verify they are true; articles based on single studies(which Constellation doesn't publish) will often give you psychology that still hasn't be proven completely, or can even have little to no validity.  Constellation is also overseen by a board of professional psychologists, who help to ensure that the articles we publish are accurate.  

The practical psychology articles we offer are written in easy to read prose prose that conveys that neverthless conveys any complexity needed to use a practical psychology finding.



## Promoting Psychology for the Public Benefit

Constellation was founded to solve the issue of making psyhcology relevent and beneficial to the public, which was first raised by Professor George Miller in 1969.  Using the principles of Professor Roberta Klatzky's Carnegie Mellon University psychology elective course as guidance, we created Constellation to bring practical psychology to everyone, and to inspire public interest in psychology.

We included an interactive map of psychology not just because it's a novelty, but because it can help show how different, seemingly unrelated aspects of psychology are different, and to inspire you to learn more about psychology.

## Constellation's Layout

You can toggle between our website's two layouts: the first is our regular layout (think layout of the Atlantic Monthly), and the second is interactive map of psychology that contains our site's practical psychology articles.  If you use our interactive map of psychology, you'll initially see our main map.  Our main map shows how branches of psychology are related.  Circles(nodes) represesnt a branch, and and lines(links) show how related the branches are.  Hover over a circle to see what branch of psychology it represents.  So the more lines there are between branches, the more related the branches are!

If you click on a circle of the main map (like physiological psychology), you'll see another map showing the circle's topics.  Clicking on a circle on this nested map will let you read about a practical psychology finding!
