## Welcome to Constellation

Want to life hack with real, usable psychology?  Constellation will let you do that!

Constellation is an interactive website that promotes psychology by making practical psychology accessible to everyone.  The practical psyhcology we offer is can be used to boost your every-day well being (want to feel happier or read facial expressions?).  We offer practical psychology in different branches of psychology, ranging from social to physiological; this means you will get to use practical psychology from nearly every field of psychology.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Orca1234/Constellation/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

## Why Constellation

Constellation cares that you get understandable high quality, practical psychology all in one place.

Constellation publishes only the highest quality practical psychology findings.  The findings we publish are systematically reviews and/or meta-analyszed, meaning that psychologists have tested them to the highest possible standards to verify they are true; articles based on single studies(which Constellation doesn't publish) will often give you psyhcology that still hasn't be proven completely, or can have little to no validity.  Constellation is also overseen by a board of professional psychologists, who help to ensure that the articles we publish are accurate.

The practical psychology articles we offer are written in easy to read prose prose that conveys that neverthless conveys any complexity needed to use a practical psychology finding.
